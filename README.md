# ukiyo-site

> **浮世 u·ki·yo** [ɯ̟ᵝkʲijo̞] *noun* fleeting existence, the transitory world

The source code for my personal website, ukiyo-site accepts generic content (such as pages and posts) and creates a website.

## Description

ukiyo-site is designed within a separation-of-concerns paradigm in which high-level functions are handled by separate codebases, allowing for long-term stability and flexibility. For example, by keeping the site contents separate from the implementation, the content is isolated and can be ported to new implementations while preserving its integrity.
