Hello! I'm Griffen, a designer and developer passionate about accessibility, internationalization, and making the web a more beautiful space. I'm also a small web enthusiast, polyglot, and <abbr title="Pacific Northwest">PNW</abbr> native. This website is hosted locally and is prone to outages.

Since 2020, I've been a Front-End Engineer with Sponsored Brands at Amazon, where I've had the opportunity to improve the customer experience of millions worldwide, namely through performance improvements, fixing accessibility defects, and creating engaging experiences.

I have a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Washington's incredible Human Centered Design & Engineering program, and I studied Japanese linguistics at the Tokyo Institute of Technology where I helped write and present two research papers, both English and Japanese.
